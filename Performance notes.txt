Performance notes:

I have written the etudes so that the performer
is only required to play intervals up to an octave.

Being able to play octaves does not necessarily
mean that all chords the size of an octave are
playable. In such cases, "standard" procedure is to
roll such chords.

Whenever possible, play 8th grace notes at the same
time as the notes immediately following them.
Please note that doing so will require stretches
larger than an octave.

In Etude 4, the time signature temporarily switches
to 2/4 during measures 94, 95, measures 116, 117,
and measures 221, 222. This is only for purposes of
notation, as not switching the time signature to
2/4 causes the notes to extend past the page
margin. These three pairs of measures are meant to
be performed as single 4/4 measures.

Some of these etudes are inspired by classical
music pieces:

Etude 3 is inspired by Un Sospiro, by Liszt.
Etude 4 is inspired by Moonlight Sonata, by
Beethoven.
Etude 5 is inspired by a specific part of La
Campanella, by Liszt. See 1:34 to 2:07 of
Rousseau's recording.
Etude 7 is inspired by Mendelssohn's Songs Without
Words, Opus 19, Number 1.
Etude 8 is inspired by a specific part of
Liebestraum 3, by Liszt. See 2:03 to 2:20 of
Rousseau's recording.
Etude 9 is inspired by the middle of Tremolo, by
Liszt. See 0:28 to 4:32 of a midi recording
[youtu.be/QekPkoEi8o0].
Etude 10 is inspired by Chopin Etude Opus 10,
Number 2.
Etude 11 is inspired by the 1838 version of
Arpeggio, by Liszt.

Sometimes, sections of an Etude will sound like
they came from another piece. This is usually
because I sometimes run out of ideas, and use other
pieces for "structural" ideas. This can also be
because I tried to write an Etude inspired by a
certain piece, but I wasn't able to work things
out, but I liked a certain section. Here are those
classical music pieces:


Measures 118 to 135 of Etude 4 are inspired by
a specific part of Liebestraum 3, by Liszt. See
2:03 to 2:20 of Rousseau's recording.

Measures 116 to 133 of Etude 5 are inspired by
a specific part of Liebestraum 3, by Liszt. See
2:03 to 2:20 of Rousseau's recording.

Measures 19 to 20, 37 to 28, 86 to 94, 112 to 115,
and 216 to 219 of Etude 6 are inspired by Chopin
Etude Opus 10, Number 4.
Measures 116 to 133 are inspired by a specific part
of La Campanella, by Liszt. See 1:34 to 2:07 of
Rousseau's recording.

Measures 116 to 133 of Etude 7 are inspired by a
specific part of La Chasse, by Liszt. See 0:24 to
0:32 of Hamelin's recording [youtu.be/9ahN-Z4KMdg].

Measures 229 to 237 of Etude 11 are inspired by a
specific part of Tremolo, by Liszt. See 0:21 to
0:26 of a midi recording [youtu.be/QekPkoEi8o0].

Occasionally similarities will be entirely
coincidential.

Measures 220 to 238 of Etude 11 should be
considered as a cadenza. Because said cadenza is
extremely long for a candenza, you are free to
replace it with your own candenza, or to simply
leave it out.

NOTE:
As of Etude 12 or later chords larger than on octave will simply have the squiggly roll thing on them.

Etude 12 comes from Chopin's Black Key Etude.
